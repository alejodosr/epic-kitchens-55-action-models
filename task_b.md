## Task B: Action Recognition (Alejandro Rodriguez Ramos)

_Use ffmpeg to split the videos youâ€™ve collected into 8 second segments and label them by putting them into folders with label names (put, take, move)._

_Next, split the folders into test and train sets._

1. _Transfer learn on one of the models above and report accuracy and loss on train_val test_val sets. Report the hardware you use for this task as well._
2. _Run inference on the videos from Task1 (exclude ones you used for training) and compare the difference between epic-kitchen models and your own trained model!_
3. _(optional) how would you improve accuracy and loss?_
4. _(optional) how would you incorporate speech data?_

_*Using GitHub commits for performing tasks above is a big plus._
