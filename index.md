## Task A: Action Recognition
### Alejandro Rodriguez Ramos

- Get familiar with the epic kitchen project: [https://epic-kitchens.github.io/2020-100](https://epic-kitchens.github.io/2020-100)
- Collect a couple of KFC kitchen videos from youtube as a dataset to perform the task.
  - The selected videos have been [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiAYDb73Dbo&t), [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-uBjf988yE&t) and [three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTv4RYEkGkQ&t)
- Go through the GitHub link: https://github.com/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-55-action-models and make use of two pre-trained models of your choice for running inference on your videos.
  - The selected models have been Temporal Segments Network (TSN) and Temporal Relation Network (TRN).
- Run the models and report the approach used and model performance (most important step). In this step, we would like to see how youâ€™d compare the models in terms of accuracy, losses, and FPS.
